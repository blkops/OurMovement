<!-- This could serve as a historical page for African Americans or blacks to know part of their history and where they came from and where they can go for more in depth information. This page can be added with the website. I believe this serves a ground in which blacks can educate themselves.-->

This document will address the lives of African Americans and Blacks of all kinds in the west. It will explain the reasons why majority of blacks resided in the Western Hemisphere. Although it's focus is on people who inherit the African Diaspora, African Americans (Blacks) in U.S will be the subject of research. This document will decribe the Atlantic slave trade and its effect on the everyday lives of Black westerners before, during and after slavery leading to current events in the 21st century. Mike Brown and Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter movement is apart of an on going fight for freedom amongst many blacks who witness emotional, psychological and systematic oppression in their everyday lives. These issues come from countless others that spark from systematic and economical roots partically in United States of America. Hopefully this will answer many questions. If not, there will be many plenty of keywords and articles research via google search and research for yourself.
